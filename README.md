# College-Work and Personal Projects 
This project is part of my coursework for the Bachelor of Business Information Systems program at MTU Cork. It demonstrates my skills in web development and interactive design. Some of the work is based on personal projects, reflecting my learning, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. I plan to enhance and expand on this project as I continue my studies. Feedback is welcome!
